# Objective
The aim of the project was to analyze various crime datasets and use them to derive patterns and insights regarding the count of crimes as well as the relationship between various demographic attributes (like income, population etc.) and crime.

The main objectives were as follows:
- Understanding the links between demographic features and crime numbers.
- Building various machine learning models to further analyze the different demographic features.
- Performing hot-spot mapping of crime throughout the city of Toronto.
- Comparison of per-capita crimes in Toronto vs other North American cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

## Datasets used
Various open-source datasets were used during this project including [Toronto Police Service (TPS) open data](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data) as well as [City of Toronto open data.](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/)
